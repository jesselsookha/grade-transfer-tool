# üìò Academia ERP ‚Äì Import Marks (Bulk Upload) Guide

This guide explains how Admin users can download the official Excel template from **Academia by Serosoft**, use our **Grade Transfer Tool** to populate it with marks, and then re-upload the CSV back into Academia.

---

## üîπ What is ‚ÄúImport Marks‚Äù / Bulk Mark Entry?

The **Import Marks** feature (sometimes called **Import Marks/Remarks**) in the **Examinations ‚Üí Manage Marks Entry** module allows administrators to upload marks in bulk via a template file.

Instead of entering marks manually for each student, you download a pre-formatted Excel template, fill or update it, and upload it back to the system.

## üîπ How to Retrieve / Download the Template

1. Navigate to **Examinations ‚Üí Manage Marks Entry**.
2. Select the **Import Marks** tab.

   * Ensure the **Download Template** option is selected.
3. Fill in the required filters:

   * **Assessment Type** ‚Äì Academic or Other.
   * **Assessment Scheme** ‚Äì Select from dropdown.

     * Student ID
     * Student Name
     * Program
     * Section
4. Click **Download Template**.

### Explanation:

* **System Columns (IDs, Names, Class Info)**
  ‚Üí These are auto-generated by Academia. Do **not** edit or delete them.

* **Student Identifiers (Admission ID, Student ID)**
  ‚Üí These must remain exactly as provided. They are used by the system to validate uploads.

* **Assessment Columns (e.g., ICE Task 1)**
  ‚Üí These are the only fields you need to populate with marks. Initially blank.

## üîπ Using the Grade Transfer Tool

Once you have:

* The **CSV file** from Brightspace (student numbers + marks).
* The **Excel template** from Academia.

Steps:

1. Open the [Grade Transfer Tool](https://jesselsookha.github.io/grade-transfer-tool/).
2. Upload both files.
3. Map the correct **Student Number** and **Marks** columns.
4. Transfer the marks (zeros are assigned automatically if missing).

   * If it‚Äôs an ICE Task, select the checkbox so marks are converted to **100 (attempted)** or **0 (not attempted)**.
5. Download the updated file as **CSV** (the tool automatically converts).

This CSV is now ready for upload into Academia.

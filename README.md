**A simple, web-based utility to transfer student marks from Brightspace CSV exports into the official Academia Excel template.**

üåê **Live version**: [Click here to use the tool](https://jesselsookha.github.io/grade-transfer-tool/)

## üöÄ Introduction

This tool was developed to support lecturers and administrators in efficiently processing student grades.  
It bridges the gap between **Brightspace D2L** (learning management system) and **Academia** (student information system).

- **Input 1:** Brightspace grade export (`.csv`)  
- **Input 2:** Academia grade template (`.xlsx`)  
- **Output:** Updated Academia template, ready for upload/processing  

The process is entirely browser-based: no installation, no external dependencies, and no student data is uploaded to a server.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Upload CSV file** ‚Äì export a grade item from Brightspace (student numbers + marks).  
2. **Upload Excel file** ‚Äì official grade sheet template downloaded from Academia.  
3. **Select columns** ‚Äì map the correct *Student Number* and *Mark* columns in both files.  
4. **Preview** ‚Äì confirm a sample of 10 records and check total counts.  
5. **Transfer** ‚Äì the tool matches students and assigns marks automatically.  
   - Blank or missing values become **0**.  
   - In *ICE Mode*, any mark > 0 is treated as **100**, otherwise **0**.  
6. **Download** ‚Äì save the updated Excel file (or CSV export) with a timestamped filename.

## üß† Notes & Tips

- Student numbers must be identical across both systems.  
- Blank marks are automatically replaced with **0**.  
- ICE Mode applies special grading logic (used for participation-based tasks).  
- Use the **Reset** button anytime to clear files and start over.  
- The tool auto-detects whether CSV uses commas (`,`) or semicolons (`;`) as separators and shows an info message.
